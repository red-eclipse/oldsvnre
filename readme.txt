= About =

Red Eclipse is a fun-filled new take on the casual first person arena
shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself
toward a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety
of environments. For more information, please see our Wiki or Forum.

The project is a Free and Open Source game, built on Cube Engine 2 using SDL
and OpenGL which allows it to be ported to many platforms; you can download
a package for Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, or grab a development copy from
our Subversion repository and live on the bleeding edge.

In a true open source by the people for the people nature, we try to work
closely with the gaming and open source communities to provide a better
overall experience, aiming to create a game environment that is fun and easy
to play, while still having elements to master.

community, so don't be afraid to speak up and have your say in building this
game for us all :)
