Red Eclipse is a Free and Open Source game, using SDL and OpenGL which
    allows it to be ported to many platforms; you can download it for both PC
    (Windows, Linux, BSD) and Mac. You can also obtain it through our
    subversion repository and live on the bleeding edge of development.

About the Project

  The game is a single-player and multi-player first-person ego-shooter, built as
    a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself toward a balanced
    gameplay, completely at the control of map makers, while maintaining a
    general theme of agility in a low gravity environment. In a true open
    source "by the people for the people" nature, it tries to work closely with
    the gaming and open source communities to provide a better overall
    experience, taking all sorts of feedback from your average player, to your
    seasoned developer, aiming to create a story-driven game environment that
    is flexible, fun, easy to use, and pleasing to the eye.

  Among the features are all the builtin (online and cooperative) editing,
    scripting, and rendering capabilities of the amazing Cube Engine 2, in
    addition to in-house work which does, or endeavours to include and extend
    upon:

    * Unique, original, and fun gameplay, storyline, theme, artwork, and content.
        Pushing the boundaries of open source first person gaming.
    * More configurable, providing an extensive range of world variables for
        mappers and game variables for players/admin to control every aspect.
    * Play plain ol' deathmatch, instagib, ctf, duel, lms, or use the select
        range of mutators and myriad of variables to create your own.
    * Item domination and dropping, fight for your lives over a great range of
        weapons, each with its own distinct personality, pros, and cons.
    * Strong artificial intelligence (A.I. or "Bots") capable of participating
        within all modes of its deathmatch environment, even online.
    * Improved editing displays and capabilities, with automatic map package
        creation and online transfers completely transparent to the user.
    * Enhanced engine systems, with extra goodies like stereoscopic or anaglyph
        view modes, and unique mouse settings.
    * The main adventure component of Red Eclipse will always be Free and
        Open Source Software, and you can contribute to it too.
