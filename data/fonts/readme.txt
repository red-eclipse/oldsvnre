Clarification: 

I ("Arand") contacted Ed Merrit (of Ten by Twenty) via email, requesting a clarification for the font license and received this response: 

> Hi Arand,

> Basically, you can use the fonts for whatever you like, the only restriction being that: 
> If the font is a "paid" one, rather than a free one, you should not make the .ttf file available to the public. 
> Other than that I'm happy for you use the font however you like.
