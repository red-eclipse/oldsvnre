= Code/Wishlist/Misc =
* free camera when at intermission ala spectator
* would attaching particles to a mapmodel be useful? (esp. wrt animated, rotating, or moving mapmodels)
* footstep sounds (and texture "materials"?)
* mode specific vars (maxhealth2/maxhealthdeathmatch, maxhealth [universal])
* tertiary firing modes (by pressing both buttons together?) [special actions? dash, etc]
* model yawscale, like pitchscale, so the torso can turn slightly before the legs follow?
* new "weapon" - shield? always equipped when carried, protects against damage?
* give all entities coloured name/icons (like hud::Ntex for text)
* give console lines each their own contextual icons?
* better damage/fire hud effects (pseudo particle system?)
* league mutator (tf2-like gameplay)
* campaign

= Models =
* Weapons (better rifle skin/norm, redo sword UVW/skin/norm and find a better idle, rework shotgun skin, adjust vwep)
* Make lower poly weapon for vwep/item
* Grunt (better punch anim, fix abdomen pitch, Sword attack anim, make less 'distorted' hud arms)
* Miscellaneous mapmodels ( generic models that could be reused in maps like barrels, doors, buttons etc. )
* Better weapon models
* vwep animations

= Art =
* Better looking fixed-width fonts?

= Sounds =
* Team change announcer?
* "imminent doom" sound when holding the ball in bomber for too long?
* Different announcer for dropped/taken instead of just "warning"?
