= Code/Wishlist/Misc =
* Commands to perform common geometry operations: slope, arch, stairs, circle, sphere?
* Move things like mastermode, ban, etc to server side commands/variables?
* Create "assisted secures" for stf (player1, player2, player3 secured flag N)
* Master server tracking and unlockable system
* event scripting (?)
* 2d-hud based damage numbers (?)
* shooting range inanimates (?)
* pathfinding and ai in campaign should schedule route generation and herd decision making to reduce overhead (?)
* allow vote for bots and random mode/mutator
* add mutator for unlimited impulse (?)
* rename normalscale to explodescale
* pid file (and daemon state (?)) for servers
* don't assume flak bounces all the time
* finish sound slot sample setup for sounds > S_GAMESPECIGFIC and < S_GAME
* invasion mutator
* "modifiers":
    like mutators for bots/etc that are voteable but carry a different priority
    eg. a vote will pass but ignore these params if the params don't pass
    would require some way of approving the parameters or not along with the vote
* traditional style radar (as an option)?
* "weights" that dynamically alters weight depending on things being carried? (esp. wrt bomber-ball)
* user-selectable colours (ensure all players are visible but not too bright?)
* should things like jetpack, power jump, and power slide be modifiers?
* would attaching particles to a mapmodel be useful? (esp. wrt animated, rotating, or moving mapmodels)
* remember to move conopen to bit 8 and shift the actions up after collating the synced ones
* sync power level on impulse meter too?
* footstep sounds (and texture "materials"?)
* mode specific vars (maxhealth2/maxhealthdeathmatch, maxhealth [universal])
* tertiary firing modes (by pressing both buttons together?) [special actions? dash, etc]
* model yawscale, like pitchscale, so the torso can turn slightly before the legs follow?
* new "weapon" - shield? always equipped when carried, protects against damage?
* in addition to hitpush/slow add a stun time?

= Models =
* Weapons (better rifle skin/norm, redo sword UVW/skin/norm and find a better idle, rework shotgun skin, adjust vwep)
* Make lower poly weapon for vwep/item
* Grunt (better punch anim, fix abdomen pitch, Sword attack anim, make less 'distorted' hud arms)
* Miscellaneous mapmodels ( generic models that could be reused in maps like barrels, doors, buttons etc. )
* Better weapon models
* vwep animations

= Art =
* Better looking fixed-width fonts?

= Sounds =
* Team change announcer?
* "imminent doom" sound when holding the ball in bomber for too long?
* Different announcer for dropped/taken instead of just "warning"?
