Red Eclipse, a fun-filled new take on the casual first person arena shooter, makes an impressive return with the release of version 1.5, codenamed "Edition". The solid dedication of the Red Eclipse team and its thriving community has led to several new ideas to enrich gameplay; 

* New weapon: electrocute your foes and reduce their agility with the all-purpose zapper.
* New models: accessorize with new vanity items and test a more refined and colorful arsenal of weaponry.
* New mutators: [explain new muts]
* New deathmatch and time-trial maps: with more levels to explore than ever before, experience new terrain as well as some remixed favorites.
* Further improved menus, GUIs, variables and gameplay options: navigate quickly and take control of all aspects or get help when needed.
* Improved weapon balance, team balance, bugs fixed, and much more.
