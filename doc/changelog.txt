The development version changelog is an ongoing work and should be reasonably
complete covering changes made up to revision:

6554 (05/30/2014)

If you update the changelog with changes made beyond this point, and consider
it to resonably cover all previous changes, please update the above revision
number.

* Only add items which you think are interesting to others, ignore those which
  you think might not be

* Please do create, update, remove and improve any entries and section titles
  as needed

* In general The ordering of sections is intented to keep items which are
  interesting to players at the top, followed by modders, server admins, etc.
  - The ordering of the entries themselves is arbitrary, loosely chronological

* The "Additional fixed bugs" section is intended to cover all items (however
  small) which have a ticket number that have been closed and
  - Are bugs which existed in the previous release which have now been fixed
  or
  - Are small enough to not warrant a note in any of the other sections

* For purely numerical changes to variables it can be convenient to use the
  instructions given at http://redeclipse.net/wiki/Vars_Changes to get a
  before-after view

* This and all the above changelog hints should be removed prior to release
