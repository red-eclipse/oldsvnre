GUIDELINES FOR CONNECTING TO THE RED ECLIPSE MASTER SERVER

The Red Eclipse Team provides the play.redeclipse.net master server for the
benefit of the Red Eclipse Community. We impose a general set of guidelines
for any server/user which connects to the play.redeclipse.net master server.
The team reserves the right to block any attempt to connect to the master
server at their discretion. Access to services provided by the project are
considered to be a privilege, not a right.

These guidelines are imposed to ensure the integrity of both the Red Eclipse
game, and its community. If you do not agree to these terms, you should not
connect to the play.redeclipse.net master server, or any servers which are
connected to it. These guidelines are not designed to limit your opinion or
freedoms granted to you by the open source licenses employed by the project,
nor do they cover usage of the game in either offline play or on servers
which are not connected to the Red Eclipse master.

If you have questions or comments regarding these guidelines please contact
the Red Eclipse Team. Any person seeking to modify their game or server for
use on the master server should first seek permission from the Red Eclipse
Team, each modification must be approved and will be done on a case-by-case
basis.


    Guidelines for Servers

(See RE Mark Policy for definitions of "substantially (un)modified")

* The gameplay of the server must not grant an undue or unfair advantage to any
  party.
  - "Humans vs Zombies" is fine, as long as it rotates roles in a fair manner.
  - Giving a single player double life permanently is not allowed.

* If the gameplay of the server is modified substantially this must be
  indicated clearly, preferably through the use of "servermotd".

* If the source code of the server is modified substantially you must contact
  the Red Eclipse Team to check that the changes are allowed.

* The server must honour the auth system, allowing global bans and admit admin
  access by the Red Eclipse Team, or moderators assigned by them.

* The server must not advertise or otherwise spam messages excessively.


    Guidelines for Users

* Players must behave in a manner that is not disruptive to the game.
  - Cussing is fine, so long as it doesn't involve bigotry (racist, religious,
    or sexually derogatory [gender or orientation] remarks).
  - Intentionally killing team mates or scoring for an opposing team is not
    allowed.
  - Flooding or spamming is not permitted.

* Whilst playing on a server connected to the master server, players should
  follow the direction and cautions of anyone who claims access with auth.
  - "user identified as handle and claimed admin/master"
  - Failure to adhere to a request by a moderator can result in an immediate
    ban, without warning, possibly from all Red Eclipse servers.
