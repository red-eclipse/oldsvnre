GUIDELINES FOR CONNECTING TO THE RED ECLIPSE MASTER SERVER

The Red Eclipse Team provides the play.redeclipse.net masterserver for the
benefit of the Red Eclipse Community. We impose a general set of guidelines
for any server/user which connects to the play.redeclipse.net master server
should follow.

The Red Eclipse Team reserves the right to block any attempt to connect to
the master server at their discretion. Access to services hosted by the Red
Eclipse Team is a privilege, not a right. If you have questions or comments
regarding these guidelines please contact the Red Eclipse Team.

GUIDELINES FOR SERVERS

(See RE Mark Policy for definitions of "substantially (un)modified")

* The gameplay of the server must not grant an undue or unfair advantage to any
  party.
  - "Humans vs Zombies" is fine, as long as it rotates roles in a fair manner.
  - Giving a single player double life permanently is not allowed.

* If the gameplay of the server is modified substantially this must be
  indicated clearly, preferably through the use of "servermotd".

* If the source code of the server is modified substantially you must contact
  the Red Eclipse Team to check that the changes are allowed.

* The server must honor the auth system, allowing global bans and admit admin
  access by the Red Eclipse Team, or moderators assigned by them.

* The server must not advertise or otherwise spam messages excessively.

GUIDELINES FOR USERS

* Players must behave in a manner that is not disruptive to the game.
  - Cussing is fine, so long as it doesn't involve bigotry (racist, religious,
    or sexal remarks).
  - Intentionally killing team mates or scoring for an opposing tean is not
    allowed.
  - Flooding or spamming is not permitted.

* Whilst playing on a server connected to the master server, players should
  follow the direction and cautions of anyone who claims access with auth.
  - "user identified as handle and claimed admin/master"
  - Failure to adhere to a request by a moderator can result in an immediate
    ban, without warning, possibly from all Red Eclipse servers.
